# ⛰️ Altépetl Digital (Obsidian Telemetry)

> **"Architect-Executive // Maker"**

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio. It is designed not as a marketing showcase, but as a **Digital Lab Notebook**.

The visual identity (**Obsidian Telemetry**) fuses the precision of an F1 Dashboard with the lithic mass of Mexica Architecture.
