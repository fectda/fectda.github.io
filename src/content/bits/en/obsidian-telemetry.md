## 🎯 The Challenge
To create a portfolio that didn't look like a portfolio.
The goal was to build a digital identity reflecting a living contradiction: **Physicist + Maker + Executive**.
Standard templates were too "soft" or corporate. We needed something that felt like a precision tool, not a marketing brochure.

## 💡 The Solution
A brutalist design system named **"Obsidian Telemetry"**.
Inspired by Formula 1 data dashboards and Mexica lithic aesthetics (Huitzilopochtli).

### 🤖 AI Swarm Development
This site was not programmed by a single human, but orchestrated by a human directing a swarm of specialized agents:
1.  **The Architect (Poposin):** Content management, structure, and project memory.
2.  **The Builder (Antigravity):** Code implementation (Astro/Vue), refactoring, and configuration.
3.  **The Designer (Stitch):** UI component generation and brutalist CSS.
4.  **The Strategist (Meta-Gem):** Concept definition and course correction.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture
*   **Core:** Astro (Static Site Generation) for extreme performance.
*   **Style:** TailwindCSS v4 with a strict color palette (#050505).
*   **Interactivity:** Island Architecture with Vue.js for complex components.
*   **Deployment:** GitHub Pages via automated CI/CD.

## 🧠 Visual Philosophy
*   **Zero Curves:** `border-radius: 0`. Structural honesty.
*   **Data over Decoration:** Monospace typography for everything.
*   **Absolute Darkness:** Permanent dark mode to reduce visual fatigue and energy consumption.
