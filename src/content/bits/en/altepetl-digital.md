## 🎯 The Challenge: Killing the "Tech Bro"
Standard tech portfolios are insipid clones: soft dark mode, rounded corners, and an obsession with looking like a Silicon Valley startup.
I am not that. I am a Neighborhood Physicist.
The challenge was to create a space that didn't scream "Hire me," but whispered **"There is structure here."** An identity merging F1 telemetry precision with the lithic mass of Mexica architecture.

## 💡 The Solution: Identity Engineering
We didn't design a website; we designed a system of visual beliefs: **"Obsidian Telemetry"**.

### 🎨 The Digital Tlacuilo Aesthetic
Design is not decoration; it is semantics.
*   **The Quincunx (Nahui Ollin):** Navigation is not a list; it's a cosmic map. 4 cardinal directions (Bits, Atoms, Mind, CV) orbiting a center (Me). Mexica universe structure applied to UX.
*   **Chichiltic & Xiuh:** We don't use "red" and "blue." We use Blood (Energy/Action) and Turquoise (Technology/Value). The contrast is violent, like a solar sacrifice.
*   **Zero Curves:** In Tlatelolco, there are no rounded corners. Everything is right angles, carved stone, brutalist functionality.

### 🛠️ Tech Decision (The Chassis)
The stack choice wasn't a whim; it was a strategy of radical optimization (Digital Ecology).
*   **Why Astro?** Because it renders static HTML (Zero JS by default). It is the most energy-efficient technology. A lightweight site is an ecological site.
*   **Why Astro Nano?** We rejected bloated templates. Nano gave us the naked chassis (bare metal) to build our own bodywork without fighting inherited styles.

### 🤖 The Council of Sages (The Orchestration)
This project is the result of directing a cabinet of synthetic experts:
1.  **Gemini (Career/ATS Expert):** Defined the "Architect-Executive" strategy. Analyzed my CV and ruled that a traditional portfolio would harm me. Proposed "Case Studies" over "Project Lists."
2.  **Gemini (Prompting Expert):** Designed the "Meta-Prompts" to control other agents. One prompt to rule them all.
3.  **Poposin ("El Carnalito"):** Drafter and curator. Charged with translating my mental chaos into structured narrative, giving voice to the "Neighborhood Scientist" and documenting every step.
4.  **Antigravity (The Builder):** Code executor under strict design constraints.
