Discomfort is not a virtue. It is not something to be endured stoically.
Discomfort is a signal of **inefficiency**.

> **[ ! ] WARNING:** Do not confuse resilience with endurance. A system that endures stress is breaking slowly. A resilient system adapts.

If a water pump requires you to climb to the roof, the system is broken.
If a data process takes 3 days and blocks the team, the system is broken.
If your house doesn't adapt to how you live, but you adapt to it, the architecture failed.

## The Principle of Redesign
This portfolio is evidence of an obsession: **Detect friction and eliminate it with engineering.**

Whether hacking Christmas lights because the original controller was dumb, or rewriting a cloud architecture because it was slow, the principle is the same:
**If it hurts, fix it.**

I am not a maker because I like gluing things together. I am a maker because I refuse to accept that things work poorly.
