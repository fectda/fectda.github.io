## Mi Historia

manifesto:
  title: "MANIFESTO"
  subtitle: "// SOURCE: USER_MINDSET [READ_ONLY]"
  bio: "I am a product of geography and contradiction. Born where a lake used to be, raised above hidden Aztec ruins, and forged on the <b>invisible border between the rough neighborhoods and the middle class</b>. I am the physicist who walks through the streets with the same ease as running a <b>gravitational wave simulation</b>."
blueBlood:
  title: "BLUE BLOOD"
  subtitle: "GOLDEN SKIN"
  body: "Physicist by training (UNAM). My career didn't start in a corporate office, but solving thermodynamics equations. This scientific foundation defines everything I do: I don't see 'software' or 'hardware', I see <b>energy systems and entropy</b>."

  warning: "// WARNING: COMFORT IS A DEPRECATED MODULE."
  body: "If a water pump requires you to climb to the roof, it's poorly designed. Discomfort is not a virtue; it is an engineering failure. <b>If it hurts, fix it.</b>"
