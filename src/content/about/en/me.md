  subtitle: "// SOURCE: USER_MINDSET [READ_ONLY]"
  bio: "I am a synthesis of geography and contradiction. Born where a lake used to be, raised above hidden Aztec ruins, and forged on the invisible border between <b>the neighborhood and the middle class</b>. I am the physicist who walks through Tlatilco with the same ease as running <b>computational statistical models</b>."

  body: "Physicist by training (UNAM). My career didn't start in a corporate office, but at CCH Azcapotzalco during the '99 strike, watching the CGH fight for my right to free education; <b>a lesson that marked me for life</b>. <br>Physics came from a coin toss that decided my fate over engineering, and I specialized in fluid mechanics chasing the dream of designing F1 wings. But the dream evolved. That foundation is my mental toolkit: I don't see <i>software</i> or <i>hardware</i>, I see systems seeking to <b>minimize energy and maximize entropy</b>."

discomfort:
  title: "DON'T GET USED TO <b>DISCOMFORT</b>"
  warning: "// WARNING: COMFORT IS A DEPRECATED MODULE."
  body: "We were taught to normalize discomfort and romanticize poverty. We were sold the idea that 'enduring' is a virtue and living with lack builds character. We were fed empty aspirations and <b>paper meritocracy</b>.<br><br>But it doesn't have to be that way. Discomfort is not nobility, it is <b>systemic friction</b>.<br><br>If a water pump requires you to climb to the roof, it's poorly designed. If you have to commute four hours a day, the solution is not buying a car, it's changing the rules of the game.<br><br>If it hurts, don't endure it: attend to it, review it, fix it. In the streets nothing is wasted—everything is reused, adapted, hacked—but <b>nothing has to hurt</b>. Efficiency is not a luxury, it is dignity."

  body: "I grew up among toys, carpentry planes, and mechanical wrenches. I learned trades before algebra, and my curiosity always manifested in disassembling (and breaking) everything to understand how it worked. <br><br> <b>I know things aren't thrown away; they are fixed</b>. <br><br> My furniture isn't from a catalog; it's designed, prototyped, and tested at home. Reclaimed demolition wood becomes functional prototypes. <br><br> <b>In my hands, I carry the heritage of artisans and engineers</b>."

      desc: "I admire Toto Wolff's team management and Newey's engineering. But what draws me in is the total symbiosis between sport and high technology. It's the only place where a millisecond is gained both in the gym and the wind tunnel."

      desc: "I am a Culé and a Tuzo. The game is won on the chalkboard and in spatial occupation. I am passionate about total football and play construction. It's not just about winning or losing, but being faithful to the style. We make football, we don't just win matches."
