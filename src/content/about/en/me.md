description: "Physicist, Maker, and Systems Architect. Living on the edge between academia and the streets."

I am a product of geography and contradiction.

Born where a lake used to be, raised above hidden Aztec ruins, and forged on the invisible border between the rough neighborhoods ("Barrio Bravo") and the middle class in Mexico City.

I am the physicist who walks through the tough streets with the same ease as running a gravitational wave simulation in Fortran.

## Blue Blood, Golden Skin (UNAM)
Physicist by training, specialized in Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics. My career didn't start by writing code; it started by solving equations. This scientific foundation defines everything I do: I don't see "software" or "hardware"—I see energy systems and entropy.

## Don't Get Used to Discomfort
This is my core engine. If a water pump requires you to climb to the roof, it's poorly designed. If a data process takes 3 days, it's inefficient. Discomfort is not a virtue; it's an engineering failure that must be fixed.

## Maker Lineage
Grandson of cabinetmakers, son of a mechanical engineer. I grew up in a workshop. I know that things aren't thrown away; they are fixed or repurposed. My temporary furniture is built from the demolition wood of my own house renovation.

## Obsessions
*   **Formula 1:** Not for the drivers, but for the engineering of Toto Wolff and Adrian Newey.
*   **Tactical Football:** Barça and Tuzos. The game is won on the chalkboard and in the spaces.
*   **Radical Ecology:** The bicycle is my urban assault vehicle. Solar panels and water harvesting are my resistance.
