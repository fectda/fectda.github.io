# 🪚 DeWalt Circular Saw Adapter for Truper Guide Rail

**Category:** Maker / 3D Printing / Tools
**Status:** Functional (v1.0)
**Stack:** FreeCAD, 3D Printing (PETG)

---

## 🎯 The Challenge
I had a **DeWalt DCS570** circular saw (chosen for blade compatibility) and a **Truper MAX-SC-G** guide rail.
**Problem:** Incompatible brands. The saw isn't designed for rails, and freehand cutting is inaccurate.
**Goal:** Create an adapter to use the saw on the rail without permanent modifications.

## 💡 The Solution
Designed a custom base in **FreeCAD** that snaps onto the saw's shoe and fits the Truper rail profile.

### 🔧 Technical Challenges & Iterations
1.  **Magnetic Failure:** Original plan used magnets, but the saw's base is aluminum.
    *   *Fix:* Press-fit design.
2.  **Print Volume:** The part was larger than my print bed.
    *   *Fix:* Modular design. Cut the model into parts with a dovetail assembly system.
3.  **Blade Guard:** The safety guard hits the rail slightly.
    *   *Workaround:* Manual lift required at start.

## 🛠️ Specs
*   **Material:** PETG (Mechanical strength).
*   **Design:** FreeCAD (Parametric).

## 🧪 Results
*   **Precision:** Excellent straight cuts.
*   **Glide:** Functional friction.
