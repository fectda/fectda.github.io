**Category:** Atoms / Civil Works
**Status:** Under Construction
**Location:** Upper Floor (Ex-Rooftop)
## 🎯 The Challenge
Expand living space without additional land. The only option was to grow upwards, transforming a service rooftop into a functional living area.

## 💡 The Solution
Architectural design of a complete apartment on the second floor, integrating laundry, full bath, and bedrooms, while respecting the structural load of the original house.
