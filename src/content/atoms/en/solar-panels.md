**Category:** Atoms / Energy / Civil Works
**Status:** Operational (Generating kWh)
**Focus:** Radical Pragmatic Ecology
## 🎯 The Challenge
The power consumption of a tech-heavy home (Servers, 3D Printers, High-performance PCs) is high.
Relying 100% on the conventional grid is not only expensive but ecologically unsustainable. The "Neighborhood Maker" vision demands responsibility for consumed resources.

## 💡 The Solution
Installation of a photovoltaic array on the roof (leveraging the second-floor renovation).

### ⚙️ Components
*   **Capture:** Monocrystalline solar panels oriented to the geographic South for maximum insolation in Mexico City.
*   **Conversion:** Grid-tied inverter synchronized with the utility network (Bidirectional meter).
*   **Monitoring:** Telemetry system reporting generation vs. consumption in real-time.

## 🛠️ Home Integration
It's not just "installing panels." The system powers the HomeLab and maker workshops.
*   **Smart Energy Strategy:** Intensive processes (like long 3D prints or video rendering) are scheduled preferentially during peak solar hours.

## 🧪 Results
*   **Carbon Footprint:** Massive reduction in CO2.
*   **Independence:** The house produces a significant portion of what it consumes.
