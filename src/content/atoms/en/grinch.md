## 🎯 The Challenge
Create a **1.20-meter** Grinch figure for Christmas cornice decoration.
The challenge was achieving correct anatomical proportions and volume at scale.

## 💡 The Solution (Cardboard Engineering)
Construction via "cross-profile" technique (Analog slicing).
An internal rigid cardboard skeleton defines the silhouette, filled for volume.

### 🔧 The Learning Process
1.  **2D Trap:** First attempts failed because we thought in flat planes.
2.  **Scaling Solution:**
    *   Found a 3D digital model.
    *   Printed a **20 cm** maquette.
    *   Measured the physical model and scaled up dimensions x6 to cut the cardboard profiles.

## 🛠️ Current State
Paused due to time constraints.
*   **Limbs:** Structure ready.
*   **Torso/Head:** Partial volume.
