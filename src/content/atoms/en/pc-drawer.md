# 🌪️ Active Filtration PC Drawer (Stealth Build)

**Category:** Maker / Hardware / Home Improvement
**Status:** Functional POC (Carpentry Phase)
**Hardware:** Open Case + AIO Liquid Cooler + MERV 13 Filters

---

## 🎯 The Challenge
Eliminate visual clutter of a PC tower while leveraging the constant airflow to **purify the room's air**.

## 💡 The Solution
A custom desk drawer with linear airflow:
1.  **Intake:** Air enters through a **MERV 13** filter (Hospital grade).
2.  **Cooling:** Clean air passes through the AIO radiator.
3.  **Exhaust:** Hot air exits the back.

## 🛠️ Current State
*   **✅ Thermal Validation:** Operational.
*   **🚧 Carpentry:** Missing rails, front panel, and filter tray mechanism.

## 🧠 Lessons
*   Validating thermodynamics before building the final furniture saved time.
