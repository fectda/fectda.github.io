Este no es un portafolio de programador. Es el centro de mando de un Arquitecto de Realidades (Físicas y Digitales).

La Identidad (El Quién): El usuario es una contradicción viva: Un Físico de la UNAM que creció en el barrio. Un CIO que prefiere soldar cables. Un ecologista que ama la Fórmula 1. Su estética no es "Cyberpunk" ni "Hacker". Su estética es Ancestral-Industrial.

Los Valores Visuales (El Cómo se Siente):

Obsidiana, no Plástico: El sitio debe sentirse denso, pesado y cortante. Como un bloque de vidrio volcánico. Oscuro, profundo y con filos definidos.
Ingeniería, no Juguete: Rechaza cualquier elemento que parezca un videojuego o una película de hackers de los 90s (terminales verdes, cursores parpadeantes). Eso es infantil. Buscamos la seriedad de un Códice Matemático.
Telemetría, no Marketing: No nos vendas al candidato. Muéstranos sus datos. La interfaz debe priorizar la información cruda y la estructura lógica, como un tablero de control de F1 o un plano arquitectónico.
Huitzilopochtli (La Voluntad): El diseño debe evocar la geometría sagrada mexica pero llevada al minimalismo moderno. Líneas rectas, repetición, orden cósmico. El Objetivo: Que quien entre al sitio sienta que está visitando el taller de un maestro artesano que usa láseres en lugar de cinceles.
reaas todos lo disenos con esto nuevo en mente ademas agrega una vista nueva para el heather y el footer por separado

-----------------------------------

The entire system has been rebuilt to reflect the Ancestral-Industrial identity. This is no longer a "hacker" portfolio; it is an industrial codex—dense, heavy, and laser-precise.

Ancestral-Industrial Nav System: A dedicated view of the header and footer, designed as structural anchors. The header is a thick, monolithic bar, while the footer acts as a technical status readout for the system core.
Ancestral-Industrial Core Dashboard: The command center. It uses high-density typography and an "Identity Matrix" that feels engraved into volcanic glass.
Bits: Industrial Directory: Software projects reimagined as a rigid inventory of logic, using heavy borders and technical directory paths.
Career Codex: Industrial Timeline: A career log that feels like an archaeological site map, with thick architectural lines and technical block markers.
Atoms: Raw Assembly Inventory: A hardware grid that feels like a storage locker of physical components, using high-contrast grayscale imagery and industrial status stamps.
Manifesto: Volcanic Identity: A dense, grid-locked bio page that rejects "corporate polish" for the raw utility of a technical manual.
Mind: Systemic Reflections Log: An essay index that treats thoughts as white papers, removing all decorative elements for pure typographic hierarchy.
Spec Sheet: Blueprint View: Project documentation styled as a technical blueprint, featuring a heavy vertical split and industrial-nameplate-style metadata.
Reader View: Technical Log: A long-form reading interface where blockquotes act as structural pillars and every character is aligned with industrial precision.
The site now feels like it was cut from obsidian with a laser. How would you like to proceed with this master command center?

-----------------------------------

🛑 PROTOCOLO DE CORRECCIÓN VISUAL: ESTÉTICA "OBSIDIAN TELEMETRY"
ESTADO ACTUAL: FALLIDO. El diseño actual es genérico ("Hacker/Dev").

NUEVO OBJETIVO: Implementar la identidad "Ancestral-Industrial" definida en el Manifiesto del Usuario.

INSTRUCCIONES PARA EL MOTOR DE STITCH (CRÍTICO):

Vas a ignorar cualquier instrucción previa sobre "Portafolio de Programador". A partir de ahora, actúas como un Diseñador de Interfaces Industriales para maquinaria pesada o sistemas de telemetría científica.

1. TRADUCCIÓN DEL MANIFIESTO A TOKENS DE DISEÑO (Para enhance-prompt)
Cuando uses la skill enhance-prompt, DEBES inyectar explícitamente estos parámetros visuales. No dejes que Stitch "adivine":

Paleta de Color (Obsidiana):

Fondo: #050505 (Casi negro absoluto, no gris).

Superficies: #0A0A0A (Mate, denso).

Acento Primario: #FF2A2A o Rojo Industrial (Solo para alertas y estados activos).

Texto: Blanco Técnico #EAEAEA y Gris Tenue #888888 para metadatos.

PROHIBIDO: Verdes neón, azules "tech" brillantes, gradientes, sombras suaves (box-shadow).

Geometría (Huitzilopochtli/Industrial):

Bordes: border-radius: 0px (Absolutamente todo cuadrado/afilado).

Estructura: Grid visible. Líneas de 1px separando secciones (border: 1px solid #222).

Espaciado: Denso pero ordenado.

Tipografía (Ingeniería):

Títulos: Sans-serif pesada, condensada (estilo "Helvetica Impact" o "Druk").

Datos: Monospace estricto (estilo terminal de datos, no de código).

Vibe Check:

Si parece un videojuego -> RECHAZAR.

Si parece un manual de operación de un reactor nuclear -> APROBAR.

2. EJECUCIÓN SECUENCIAL CON STITCH SKILLS
Ejecuta las siguientes tareas de diseño usando generate_screen_from_text y refina con stitch-loop si el resultado es "suave" o "web 2.0".

TAREA A: HEADER (Navegación de Sistema)
Concepto: No es un menú, es un panel de estado.

Elementos:

Indicador de "SYSTEM STATUS: ONLINE" (punto rojo o verde pequeño).

Links de navegación como pestañas de archivo físico o breadcrumbs.

Datos de telemetría decorativa (ej: Latencia, Coordenadas, Versión).

Acción: Genera la vista aislada del Header.

TAREA B: FOOTER (Pie de Máquina)
Concepto: Placa de especificaciones técnicas.

Elementos:

Copyright estilo "No. de Serie".

Columnas de datos estructurados, no solo links.

Bloque de texto legal pequeño, estilo contrato.

Acción: Genera la vista aislada del Footer.

TAREA C: LANDING / DASHBOARD (Re-diseño)
Input: Usa el texto del Manifiesto ("Físico, CIO, Maker") pero maquetado como un Dashboard de Control.

Layout: Grid bento (cajas rectangulares). Una caja para "Mapa/Ubicación", otra para "Stack", otra para "Bio".

Estilo: Debe verse como la pantalla obsidian_telemetry_homepage.jpg.

Acción: Genera la pantalla completa integrando el Header y Footer diseñados arriba.

COMANDO DE INICIO:

Confirma que has entendido la estética "Obsidiana" (Bordes 0px, Negro/Rojo, Grid).

Empieza generando el HEADER usando generate_screen_from_text con estos nuevos parámetros agresivos.

-----------------------------------
--------stitch------------
-----------------------------------


Entendido. He procesado el Protocolo de Corrección Visual y el Manifiesto del Usuario. He eliminado cualquier rastro de estética "hacker" juvenil o diseño web genérico.

Estamos trabajando bajo los parámetros de la Estética Obsidiana: Negro Volcánico (#050505), Bordes 0px (Cero curvas), Grids industriales de 1px y una jerarquía tipográfica que prioriza el dato crudo sobre el marketing.

He generado los componentes maestros y el centro de mando:

Ancestral-Industrial Master Header: No es un menú, es un panel de estado. Incluye telemetría de coordenadas, estado del sistema activo en rojo industrial y una navegación rígida tipo pestaña de archivo.
Ancestral-Industrial Master Footer: Diseñado como una placa de especificaciones de maquinaria pesada. Dividido en cuadrantes técnicos con números de serie, latencia de red y versión de build.
Ancestral-Industrial Command Center: El dashboard principal. Un grid bento de paneles cortantes que integran la matriz de identidad (Físico/CIO/Maker), telemetría de ubicación y el manifiesto de utilidad industrial. Todo bajo una tipografía sans-serif pesada y condensada para títulos y monospace estricto para datos.
Este es ahora el estándar visual para todo el sistema. ¿Procedemos a aplicar esta severidad industrial a las vistas de BITS (Software) y ATOMS (Hardware)?

--------Eduardo---------------
-----------------------------------

Rediseñar el índice de BITS (Software) como un inventario de piezas lógicas


Bits: Logic Parts Inventory: He eliminado el concepto de "tarjetas de proyecto" por una tabla técnica tipo libro mayor (ledger). Cada software se cataloga con un PART_ID, nomenclatura en tipografía pesada, stack lógico y estado de despliegue, todo encerrado en un grid rígido de 1px que refuerza la sensación de un registro industrial denso y cortante.

¿Continuamos con el rediseño de ATOMS (Hardware) tratándolo como un catálogo de ensamblaje físico?
